                <h2 class="display-3">Frequenty Asked Questions</h2>
                <h2>Q: Do I need to know how to code to join?</h2>
                  <p>No! Crimson Defense is welcome to any person, regardless of their skill level! 
                    While you may be more comfortable at our meetings with some knowledge of cyber security topics, it is never required, nor enforced. 
                    In fact, many cyber security tools do not require advanced programming knowledge.
                    Come to our meetings with an open mind and curiosity! We'll take care of the rest. 
                    </p>
                <h2>Q: I have never competed before. Can I still join the Competition Team?</h2>
                      <p>Yes! We welcome anyone of any ability level to join our competition teams! You do not need to be an expert to 
                        compete, many of our competitions are very beginner-friendly. We highly encourage you to try. After all,
                        experience is the best teacher!
                        </p>
                <h2>Q: I'm not sure where to start with cyber security?</h2>
                      <p>You are not alone, many students who are new to cyber aren't sure where to start. We suggest downloading Kali Linux and exploring the tools in it. 
                        Check out our <a href="compteam.html">Competition Team</a> page for links to download Kali and Virtual Machine software.
                        If you would like a personal introduction to cyber security, you can start by attending our <a href="projectcrimson.html">Project Crimson</a> sessions and get assistance from a peer mentor, just tell them you're new! 
                      </p>
                <h2>Q: Why should I join Crimson Defense?</h2>
                  <p><em>Let's let some of our club members answer this question:</em></p>
                    <p>Not only is it important to learn about security concepts even if you aren't a cyber major, but also there are concepts taught that are useful for more than just cyber security. <b>The club also provides a community of people to talk to about various computer-related topics</b>; if you ask around about it, chances are someone will be able to help you.
                    </p>
                        <p>- Josh Keane, Project Crimson Mentor</p>
                    <p>It introduces more <b>diverse and different but intriguing aspects of the field</b> that aren't as stressful as an academic class or an almost exclusively career oriented club.</p>
                        <p>- Rei Wu, Crimson Defense Member</p>
                    <p>Crimson Defense has given me more opportunities to learn about topics related to cyber security, which is my major. This has <b>helped me greatly as a freshman because now I am more knowledgeable on what to expect in my career field.</b></p>
                        <p>- Jena Blose, Crimson Defense Member</p>
                    <p>Honestly, Crimson Defense is a very big part of my life. <b>It's where a lot of my friends are, where they spend a lot of my time, and it's a great organization that I want to see continue to flourish and grow</b>. I have grown to appreciate my fellow officers, and I feel like I've become close friends with most of them.
                    I feel like that description doesn't do it justice.
                    But I'm not that great with words.
                    </p>
                        <p>- Lawson Smith, Chief of Staff 2024</p>
                    <p>Well, Crimson Defense means an awful lot to me. I've loved the field of Cybersecurity ever since I participated in my first CTF back in high school. Since then, <b>Crimson Defense has allowed me to find a community of other people who are interested in the same thing I am passionate about</b>. It's a club where I can learn, I can compete, and I can make connections with like-minded people. I love learning about Cybersecurity topics, and then putting that knowledge into action via competitions. <b>I love how welcoming the club is, how well everyone gets along, and how everyone is eager to lend a hand if you need any help</b>. Overall, Crimson Defense has been an important part of my college experience, and I have a lot to thank Crimson Defense for.
